<h2> Getting Started </h2>

Before you start, make sure you have necessary software installed in your local machine.

<h2> Objective </h2>

This project is a simple Flask-based Python application deployed using Docker containers. The setup leverages Docker Daemon, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), and Flask to create a seamless development and deployment experience. The goal is to demonstrate how to build image, run and deploy application using containerization
Additionally, it aims to provide an understanding of the projectâ€™s file structure.

<h2> Pre-requisites </h2> 

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed on your machine: <br>

- [WSL-2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install): Required for running Linux-based containers on Windows. <br>
- [Docker Desktop/Daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): The Docker Engine to build and run containers. <br>
- [Docker Hub Account](https://hub.docker.com/): For optionally pushing and pulling Docker images. <br>

<h2> Procedures </h2>

Follow the instructions provided in *[instructions.txt](https://github.com/JioGraphy/Python-Dockerized/blob/master/instructions.txt)* file


<h2> File Structure </h2>

> - **`app.py`**: The main entry point for the Flask application. <br>
> - **`Dockerfile`**: The configuration file used to build the Docker image for the application. <br>
> - **`Instructions.txt`**: A step-by-step guide on how to perform each action, from setup to deployment. <br>
> - **`README.md`**: A comprehensive overview of the project, including setup, usage, and other relevant information. <br>
> - **`requirements.txt`**: A list of required Python packages to be installed within the Docker container. <br>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

After following the instructions. You now have a simple Python web application running in a Docker container. This process covered creating a Python app, building, containerizing it with Docker, and optionally push/pull it to or from Docker Hub for distribution.
