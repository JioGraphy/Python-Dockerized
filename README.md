<h2> Overview </h2>
This project is a simple Flask-based Python application deployed using Docker containers. The setup leverages Docker Daemon, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), and Flask to create a seamless development and deployment experience. The goal is to demonstrate how to build image, run and deploy application using containerization

<h2> Getting Started </h2>
Before you start, make sure you have necessary software installed in your local machine.

<h2> Objective </h2>
This project is a simple Flask-based Python application deployed using Docker containers. The setup leverages Docker Daemon, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), and Flask to create a seamless development and deployment experience. The goal is to demonstrate how to build image, run and deploy application using containerization
Additionally, it aims to provide an understanding of the projectâ€™s file structure.

<h2> Pre-requisites </h2>
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **[WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)**: Required for running Linux-based containers on Windows.
- **[Docker Desktop/Daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)**: The Docker Engine to build and run containers.
- **[Docker Hub Account](https://hub.docker.com/)**: For optionally pushing and pulling Docker images.

<h2> Procedures </h2>
Follow the instructions provided in 'instructions.txt' file

<h2> File-Structure </h2>
- **`app.py`**: The main entry point for the Flask application.
- **`Dockerfile`**: The configuration file used to build the Docker image for the application.
- **`Instructions.txt`**: A step-by-step guide on how to perform each action, from setup to deployment.
- **`README.md`**: A comprehensive overview of the project, including setup, usage, and other relevant information.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of required Python packages to be installed within the Docker container.

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
After following the instructions. You now have a simple Python web application running in a Docker container. This process covered creating a Python app, building, containerizing it with Docker, and optionally push/pull it to or from Docker Hub for distribution.
