STEP 1: Set Up Your Python Application

    1.1 Create a Project Directory
        "mkdir simple-python-app"
        "cd simple-python-app"

    1.2 Create a Python Script
        Create a file named app.py and add the following simple web server code using Flask in app.py file:

    1.3 Create a requirements.txt file to list the dependencies, copy it from requirements.txt:


STEP 2: Create a Dockerfile

    2.1 Write the Dockerfile
        In the same directory, create a file named Dockerfile and add the following content from DockerFile:


STEP 3: Build the Docker Image

    3.1 Run the following command in your project directory:
        "docker build -t simple-python-app:insert_tag_here  -f DockerFile ." 
        This command builds the Docker image and tags it as simple-python-app.


STEP 4: Run the Docker Container

    4.1 Check if Docker is up and running
        "service docker status"

    4.2 Run the Container
        "docker run -d -p 5000:5000 simple-python-app:insert_tag_here ."
        This maps port 5000 on your local machine to port 5000 in the container in dettach mode.

    4.2 Check if container run successfully
        "docker ps"
        This will verify and display all running containers


STEP 5: Access Your Application

    5.1 Test Your Application
        Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
        You should see "Hello, World!" displayed in your browser.


STEP 6: Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub (Optional)

    6.1 Login to Docker Hub
        If you want to push your Docker image to Docker Hub, first login:
        "docker login"
        Provide the credentials that you use to signup to docker hub

    6.2 Tag your image to match your Docker Hub repository:
         "docker tag simple-python-app:test your_user_name/repo_name:simple-python-app"
    
    6.3 Push the Image
        Push the tagged image to Docker Hub:
        "docker push your-dockerhub-username/simple-python-app"


STEP 7: Pull and Run the Image from Docker Hub anywhere (OPTIONAL) 

    7.1 Pull the Image
    On another machine or environment, pull the image from Docker Hub:
    docker pull your-dockerhub-username/simple-python-app:tag_here

    7.2 Run the Container
    Run the container as described in Step 4:
    "docker run -d -p 5000:5000 simple-python-app:insert_tag_here ."
